Hello,  

I’m an ordinary mom living with my husband, who never misses his three meals a day,  
and our baby born in Oct 2024, who bursts into tears every morning claiming he’s hungry.  
Most of my day is spent busily going back and forth between the kitchen and the living room.  

I started this blog to record and share my small daily life — traces of cooking and parenting.  
These days may seem ordinary, but within them are warm moments I want to share.  
What might be a regular day for someone else is, for me, a new challenge every day —  
a time when love accumulates, little by little.

## 🍞 Baking Stories

I knead dough quickly during the short naps my baby takes,  
and feel so happy when the warm, toasty smell spreads from the oven.  
In those brief moments of peace, I often find myself again.

For now, only my husband and I can eat them,  
but I’m looking forward to the day when my child will smile while eating bread I baked.  
In fact, I’ve dreamed of a home that smells of freshly baked bread even before I got married.  
When salt bread comes out of the oven golden brown,  
the scent alone warms my heart,  
and that small sense of accomplishment makes the rest of my day brighter.

## 🥣 Baby Food Journey

At first, everything felt strange and difficult.  
“Is this okay?” “Is it too watery?” “Is the amount just right?”  
Every day was an experiment, and I felt sad when my baby didn’t eat.  

But even in that process, I learned a lot.  
I discovered little by little which ingredients my baby liked,  
and every time he ate a little more, I felt so proud.  

So I hope this can bring a little comfort and help  
to other parents who are starting baby food for the first time.  
It’s okay to not be perfect —  
we’re all learning step by step together.

## 🍚 Warmth of Korean Cuisine

When simple dishes like my mom’s soybean paste stew and stir-fried anchovies  
are reborn at my hands and appear on our family table,  
I feel so proud and warm inside.  

These days, I’ve come to prefer this kind of neat Korean food  
over fancy dishes.  
Food made to preserve the natural flavor of ingredients  
and with my family’s health in mind  
feels like a gift filled with love.  

As my baby slowly starts eating rice,  
he’s learning the deep flavors of Korean food too.  
Watching that, I feel emotional knowing  
that the warm dining table I learned from my mother  
is now being passed down to my child.

## 👶 Parenting Growth Diary

When my baby first rolled over, crawled,  
and grabbed my hands with both of his,  
every single moment was so precious  
that I wanted to record them here.

At first, each day felt overwhelming and exhausting,  
but even then, every little change in my baby  
brought me great joy.  

Someday, I hope we can look back at this together and smile.  
“At that time, you were this small.”  
“You were so cute when you were eating baby food.”  
I’m sure the day will come when we can share such stories.
