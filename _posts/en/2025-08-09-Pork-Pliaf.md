🧅 Preparing the Vegetables and Marinating the Boston butt  
I used whatever vegetables we had at home for the pilaf:  

>
	•	Zucchini  
	•	Carrot  
	•	Onion  
	•	Mushrooms  
	•	400g Boston butt  
	•	1 tbsp minced garlic  
	•	1 tbsp sugar  
	•	3 tbsp soy sauce  
	•	3 tbsp olive oil  
{: .prompt-tip }

The Boston butt was marinated overnight beforehand.
Bell peppers feel like an essential ingredient — they definitely add more flavor!
It’s best to chop the vegetables into small pieces so they cook evenly and mix well with the rice.

Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
My husband loves meat, so I used a generous amount of Boston butt 😄
Make sure the marinade isn’t too salty so the meat’s natural flavor shines through.
Marinating overnight makes the meat more tender and flavorful.

## 🍳 Let’s Start Stir-Frying!

First, stir-fry the onions and carrots.
You don’t need much oil since the vegetables release moisture as they cook naturally.
Next, add the zucchini and mushrooms and stir-fry together.

When they’re somewhat cooked, add the marinated Boston butt.

Once the meat starts cooking, add 2 bowls of cooled rice and stir-fry together.
It’s better if the rice isn’t too hot.

Add 1 tbsp oyster sauce and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavor.
Stir-fry until the bottom gets slightly crispy — that makes it even tastier!

The pilaf was a bit sticky since the rice was a little wet, but that’s part of its charm too, haha.

## 🍳 With Fried Eggs

No pilaf is complete without fried eggs!
Since it was for two people, I fried 4 eggs generously.

The yolks cooked slightly runny, which tastes best.
We also enjoyed it with some spicy chopped chili on the side.

Adding fried eggs makes the dish look more appealing and adds a nutty richness, making the pilaf more hearty.
