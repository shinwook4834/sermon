Revelation 22:16–21  
16 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”  
17 The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.  
18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll.  
19 And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.  
20 He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.  
21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.

# 📖 “I Am Coming Soon” – The Meaning of the Second Coming

When Jesus promised, *“I am coming soon,”* He did not simply refer to chronological time. His words carry **certainty, imminence, and inevitability**. Though God patiently waits so that more souls may be saved, the day will surely come. For the early church, this promise was the greatest comfort and hope; for us today, it calls for a life of continual readiness.

# 📖 Living with the Hope of His Coming

The Second Coming is the central axis of Christian life.  
- **Looking to eternity rather than the present**: When we set our hope on eternity, we can live faithfully in the present.  
- **Living by heavenly standards**: As Paul exhorts, “Set your hearts on things above” (Col 3:1), not on worldly values.  
- **Living watchfully**: Since His coming will be like a thief in the night, we must live not in indulgence but in holiness.  

---

# 📖 Abounding in the Work of the Lord

Paul defined eschatological faith as being those who *“always abound in the work of the Lord”* (1 Cor 15:58).  
- The Lord’s work is **never in vain**.  
- The Lord’s work is **what pleases Him**.  
- The Lord’s work leads to **heavenly reward**. Salvation is given by grace, but reward is given according to faithfulness and devotion.

# 📖 The Attitude of the Prepared – Maranatha Faith

The early church greeted one another with *“Maranatha”* (“Come, Lord Jesus”).  
This was not just a greeting, but a **confession of their eschatological faith**. We too must live with the tension of *“What if today were that day?”*

# 📖 The Vanity of the World and the Eternity of Heaven

The Preacher declared, *“Meaningless! Meaningless! Everything is meaningless.”*  
- All worldly achievements will eventually fade.  
- True satisfaction is found only in heaven.  
- Fixing our eyes on heaven allows us to rightly interpret life on earth.  

C.S. Lewis once said, *“Aim at heaven and you will get earth ‘thrown in’: aim at earth and you will get neither.”*

---

# 📖 The Bible’s Last Word – Grace

Revelation closes with: *“The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people”* (22:21).  
- The conclusion of Scripture is **grace**.  
- Salvation is grace, life is grace, and eternal glory is grace.  
- The believer’s life begins with grace and ends with grace.  

---

# 📖 Christ’s Coming as the Morning Star

Jesus called Himself *“the bright Morning Star.”* The morning star shines just before dawn, signaling that night is ending and a new day is about to break. His return will be the **final morning star of history** and the beginning of eternal glory.  

Therefore, we must live today as prepared servants, faithful stewards, and believers who endure to the end.
