- For nuclides with atomic number $Z$ greater than 20, more neutrons than protons are needed for stability
- Neutrons help bind the nucleus together, overcoming the electrical repulsion between protons

## Reasons for Radioactive Decay
- Only specific combinations of neutrons and protons form stable nuclides
- If the neutron-to-proton ratio is too high or too low, the nuclide is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay
- The nucleus formed after decay is usually in an excited state, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays or X-rays

## Beta Decay ($\beta$-decay)
### Positron Decay ($\beta^+$-decay)

 $$p \to n+\beta^+ +\nu_e$$
 
- Occurs when there is a relative shortage of neutrons
- A proton ($p$) changes into a neutron ($n$), emitting a positron ($\beta^+$) and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$)
- Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number remains unchanged

Example: $^{23}\_{12}\text{Mg} \to\;^{23}\_{11}\text{Na} + e^+ + \nu_e$

### Electron Decay ($\beta^-$-decay)

$$ n\to p+\beta^- + \overline{\nu}_e $$

- Occurs when there is a relative excess of neutrons
- A neutron ($n$) changes into a proton ($p$), emitting an electron ($\beta^-$) and an electron antineutrino ($\overline{\nu}_e$)
- Atomic number increases by 1, mass number remains unchanged

Example: $^3_1\text{H} \to\;^3_2\text{He} + e^- + \overline{\nu}_e$

- Electrons or positrons emitted in beta decay show a continuous energy spectrum as shown above.
- $\beta^-$ decay: $\overline{E}\approx 0.3E_{\text{max}}$
- $\beta^+$ decay: $\overline{E}\approx 0.4E_{\text{max}}$

### Decay Chain
Often, the daughter nuclide formed through beta decay is also unstable and undergoes subsequent beta decay. This leads to a decay chain as follows:

$$ ^{20}\text{O} \overset{\beta^-}{\rightarrow}\;^{20}\text{F} \overset{\beta^-}{\rightarrow}\;^{20}\text{Ne (stable)} $$ 

## Electron Capture or K-capture

$$ p + e \to n + \nu_e $$

- Occurs when there is a relative shortage of neutrons
- Captures an electron from the innermost shell (K-shell) to convert a proton in the nucleus into a neutron
- Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number remains unchanged
- After electron capture, a vacancy is created in the electron cloud, which is later filled by an outer electron, emitting X-rays or Auger electrons
- The daughter nuclide produced by electron capture is identical to that produced by $\beta^+$ decay, so these two processes compete with each other

## Alpha Decay ($\alpha$-decay)
- Emits an alpha particle ($\alpha$, $^4_2\text{He}$)
- Atomic number decreases by 2, and mass number decreases by 4
- Common in nuclei heavier than lead
- Unlike beta decay, the energy of alpha particles emitted in alpha decay is quantized

Example: $^{238}\_{92}\text{U} \to\;^{234}\_{90}\text{Th} +\; ^4_2\text{He}$

## Spontaneous Fission
- Very heavy and unstable nuclides can undergo fission without absorbing neutrons
- Included in radioactive decay in a broad sense

## Proton Emission
- In extremely proton-rich unstable nuclides, a single proton can be emitted
- Atomic number and mass number decrease by 1
- Occurs very rarely

## Decay Scheme and Isomeric Transition
### Decay Scheme
Decay scheme: A visual representation of all decay paths of a radioactive material

### Isomeric Transition
- Nuclei formed by radioactive decay may remain in an excited state after transformation, in which case they release energy in the form of gamma rays (although not strictly decay, the term gamma decay is conventionally used when gamma rays are emitted, as the nuclide does not change).
- Most excited nuclei transition to the ground state by emitting gamma rays in a very short time, but in certain cases, gamma ray emission is delayed, appearing like a metastable state. This delayed state is called the isomeric state of the nucleus.
- The transition from an isomeric state to the ground state by emitting gamma rays is called an isomeric transition and is denoted as IT.
