## Todayâ€™s Recovery Meal for My Husband Returning from a Business Trip

Whenever my husband comes back from a business trip, he looks especially tired. So I always prepare a **recovery meal** for him. This time, I made **braised short ribs (galbijjim), japchae, and chive pancakes**â€”his favorites. These dishes take time and effort, but theyâ€™re filled with love and care.

### Starting with Galbijjim

First, I thoroughly wash the **beef short ribs** and soak them in **sugar water to remove the blood**. Itâ€™s a time-consuming step, but essential to eliminate any unpleasant odor.

While the ribs soak, I prepare the **sauce and ingredients**. I followed a recipe from Salimpop:

>
- Soy sauce 20T  
- Mirim 10T  
- Sugar 3T  
- Oligodang (rice syrup) 4T  
- Garlic 4T  
- Oyster sauce 3T   
- Pepper 1T  
- Sesame oil 1T  
- Ginger 1T   
{: .prompt-tip }

I cut the onions into large chunks for the galbijjim and thin slices for japchae and chive pancakes. Using a slicer makes prep much faster.

%}

I also prepare plenty of chives for both japchae and pancakes. I love adding chives to japchaeâ€”they help balance the richness. Shiitake mushrooms are cut into star shapes for galbijjim and thin slices for japchae. Colorful bell peppers are sliced to brighten the dish. After soaking, the ribs are blanched in boiling water for 10 minutes. I added **star anise** for extra aroma.

%}

Then I pour the sauce over the blanched ribs, add 2L of water, and toss in all the prepared vegetables. Once it starts boiling, I simmer it **covered for 40 minutes**, then **uncovered for another 40 minutes**.

Finally, I add **shishito peppers** for a pop of color and flavor. By now, the house is filled with a delicious aroma.

### Simple Yet Delicious Chive Pancakes

Here are the ingredients for the chive pancakes:

>
- 3T flour  
- Dried baby shrimp  
- Tuna fish sauce  
- Carrot  
{: .prompt-tip }

I use minimal flourâ€”just 3T. I add **dried baby shrimp** for texture and umami, and season with **tuna fish sauce**.

Mix everything well and pan-fry until golden brown. The result is crispy pancakes with a fragrant chive aroma.

Though simple, chive pancakes require attention. The batter consistency and pan temperature are key. But the crispy texture and chive flavor make it a perfect dish for my husband.

### Japchaeâ€”Even with a Small Mistake

Japchae sauce includes:

>
- Olive oil 2T  
- Soy sauce 5T  
- Sugar 1T  
- Mirin 1T  
- Oligodang 2T  
{: .prompt-tip }

When the sauce starts boiling, I was supposed to add the noodlesâ€”but I accidentally added the meat first ðŸ˜… It was past midnight, and I was losing focus.

%}

Still, I didnâ€™t give up. I added fresh vegetables and stir-fried them with the noodles. Finished with **sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds**.

Japchae requires a lot of prep and careful timing. Though things got a bit mixed up, I tried my best to make it tasty. With chives, bell peppers, and shiitake mushrooms, it turned out colorful and flavorful.

### All Done! A Meal Full of Love

After finishing galbijjim, japchae, and chive pancakes, it was nearly dawn. Thankfully, my mom helped with cleanup and organizing the kitchenâ€”her help was invaluable.
