    "content": "Pilaf might sound like something you can only find in foreign restaurants, but these days it’s easy to enjoy at home. Originally from the Middle East and Mediterranean, pilaf was made by sautéing rice with spices and spread to Europe through the Crusades and trade. By adding juicy Korean pork neck, soy sauce, and fresh vegetables, we get a Korean-style twist — Pork Neck Pilaf. The savory aroma of pork blends beautifully with the natural sweetness of veggies, making it a one-bowl comfort meal."

    "content": "Salt Butter Rolling comes from Brittany, France, a coastal region famous for its sea salt and top-quality butter. Long ago, bakers combined these two treasures to create a bread that’s crisp on the outside, soft inside, and sprinkled with coarse salt for a delightful savory bite. It’s not sweet, making it perfect with coffee or tea. In recent years, it’s become a must-try treat in Korea, with people lining up to get a taste."
