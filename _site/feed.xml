    Hello :) Today I made one of our family’s favorite dishes — Boston butt pilaf. My husband especially loves it, and it’s a simple recipe packed with flavor that makes a satisfying meal.

    <p>🧅 Preparing the Vegetables and Marinating the Boston butt<br />
I used whatever vegetables we had at home for the pilaf:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <ul>
    <li>Zucchini</li>
    <li>Carrot</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Mushrooms</li>
    <li>400g Boston butt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The Boston butt was marinated overnight beforehand.
Bell peppers feel like an essential ingredient — they definitely add more flavor!
It’s best to chop the vegetables into small pieces so they cook evenly and mix well with the rice.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-preparation.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
My husband loves meat, so I used a generous amount of Boston butt 😄
Make sure the marinade isn’t too salty so the meat’s natural flavor shines through.
Marinating overnight makes the meat more tender and flavorful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-lets-start-stir-frying">🍳 Let’s Start Stir-Frying!</h2>

<p>First, stir-fry the onions and carrots.
You don’t need much oil since the vegetables release moisture as they cook naturally.
Next, add the zucchini and mushrooms and stir-fry together.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-Moksal.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>When they’re somewhat cooked, add the marinated Boston butt.</p>

<p>Once the meat starts cooking, add 2 bowls of cooled rice and stir-fry together.
It’s better if the rice isn’t too hot.</p>

<p>Add 1 tbsp oyster sauce and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavor.
Stir-fry until the bottom gets slightly crispy — that makes it even tastier!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-main.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>The pilaf was a bit sticky since the rice was a little wet, but that’s part of its charm too, haha.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-with-fried-eggs">🍳 With Fried Eggs</h2>

<p>No pilaf is complete without fried eggs!
Since it was for two people, I fried 4 eggs generously.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-Egg.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>The yolks cooked slightly runny, which tastes best.
We also enjoyed it with some spicy chopped chili on the side.</p>

<p>Adding fried eggs makes the dish look more appealing and adds a nutty richness, making the pilaf more hearty.</p>

<p>Sharing this meal with my beloved husband and baby
feels warmer and more special than any fancy dish.</p>

<p>This one plate of pilaf enriches our day.</p>

    <p>Hello there :)<br />
Today, I’d love to share my experience making one of my favorite breads — <strong>salt bread</strong> — at home.<br />
My husband especially loves this bread, so I bake it quite often. This time, I followed Duke’s recipe.<br />
I’m self-taught in baking, so there may be some rough edges, but that just means the recipe is full of love.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-lets-start-with-the-ingredients">🧑‍🍳 Let’s Start with the Ingredients</h2>
<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <p>First, let’s measure everything:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bread flour: 200g</li>
    <li>Cake flour: 50g</li>
    <li>Skim milk powder: 15g (I used leftover baby formula instead)</li>
    <li>Dry yeast: 3g</li>
    <li>Salt: 5g</li>
    <li>Sugar: 15g</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to keep the yeast, salt, and sugar from touching each other directly.<br />
Coat each with flour before mixing all the dry ingredients evenly.</p>

<p>Next, add 165ml of water.<br />
Here’s a key tip! Use <strong>tap water</strong> — it helps fermentation more than purified water.<br />
Mix with a spatula until it clumps together, then let it <strong>rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-time-to-knead">🌀 Time to Knead!</h2>

<p>After 30 minutes, it’s time to knead.<br />
I used the <strong>L’EQUIP dough mixer</strong> (not sponsored 😊).<br />
The great thing about this mixer is that it automatically adjusts speed and time with one button,<br />
and even tells you when to add butter — super helpful for home bakers!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-mixer.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Once the dough is ready, tidy it up and start fermentation.<br />
Cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying, and let it <strong>ferment at room temperature for 60 minutes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-shaping-and-resting">🍞 Shaping and Resting</h2>

<p>After fermentation, divide the dough into <strong>70g portions</strong>.<br />
This recipe makes 6 salt breads.<br />
If there’s leftover dough, just add a bit to each of the 6 portions.</p>

<p>Now let’s round the dough.<br />
Fold it inward, then roll it into a ball on a mat or with your palm.<br />
Next, shape it into a <strong>tadpole shape</strong> — tapering toward the tail is key!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-shaping01.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Let the shaped dough <strong>rest at room temperature for 20 minutes</strong>.<br />
After resting, stretch the dough.<br />
Push the top part and pull the bottom part downward as you roll.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-shaping02.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-butter-filling-and-shaping-tips">🧈 Butter Filling and Shaping Tips</h2>

<p>Now place the butter filling on the top part and gently roll it up.<br />
Repeat the same for the rest of the dough.</p>

<p>Some salt bread recipes suggest sealing the sides after adding butter,<br />
while others leave them open.</p>

<p>Korean master baker <strong>Bread Junseo</strong> says:<br />
“For salt bread, leaving the sides open allows the butter to naturally flow out and absorb into the bottom,<br />
making it crispy.”<br />
So I also leave the sides open.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-final-proof-and-baking">🔥 Final Proof and Baking</h2>

<p>Let the shaped dough <strong>proof for about 60 minutes</strong>.<br />
Usually, you sprinkle a bit of salt on top after proofing,<br />
but I skipped that this time.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to <strong>220°C</strong>,<br />
then bake at <strong>200°C for 20 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-beforebake.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Once baked, your salt bread is ready!<br />
It’s delicious as is, but if you <strong>brush a little leftover butter on top</strong>,<br />
it adds a glossy finish and makes it look even more appetizing.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-baked.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>After cooling a bit, cracks may appear on the surface —<br />
but I find that adds to its charm.</p>

<h2 id="-wrapping-up">💛 Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Though I’m self-taught and still learning,<br />
the biggest reward is seeing my <strong>family enjoy the bread</strong>.<br />
Since it’s my husband’s favorite, I keep coming back to it.</p>

<p>Salt bread uses simple ingredients,<br />
and with a little care, you can make it delicious at home.</p>

<p>I hope you give it a try :)<br />
The savory aroma from the oven and a warm table<br />
can make your day just a little happier.</p>
