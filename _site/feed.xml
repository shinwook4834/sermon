    <p>Hello there :)<br />
Today, I’d love to share my experience making one of my favorite breads — <strong>salt bread</strong> — at home.<br />
My husband especially loves this bread, so I bake it quite often. This time, I followed Duke’s recipe.<br />
I’m self-taught in baking, so there may be some rough edges, but that just means the recipe is full of love.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-lets-start-with-the-ingredients">🧑‍🍳 Let’s Start with the Ingredients</h2>

<p>First, let’s measure everything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bread flour: 200g</li>
  <li>Cake flour: 50g</li>
  <li>Skim milk powder: 15g (I used leftover baby formula instead)</li>
  <li>Dry yeast: 3g</li>
  <li>Salt: 5g</li>
  <li>Sugar: 15g</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to keep the yeast, salt, and sugar from touching each other directly.<br />
Coat each with flour before mixing all the dry ingredients evenly.</p>

<p>Next, add 165ml of water.<br />
Here’s a key tip! Use <strong>tap water</strong> — it helps fermentation more than purified water.<br />
Mix with a spatula until it clumps together, then let it <strong>rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-time-to-knead">🌀 Time to Knead!</h2>

<p>After 30 minutes, it’s time to knead.<br />
I used the <strong>L’EQUIP dough mixer</strong> (not sponsored 😊).<br />
The great thing about this mixer is that it automatically adjusts speed and time with one button,<br />
and even tells you when to add butter — super helpful for home bakers!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-mixer.JPG" alt="Using the mixer" /></p>

<p>Once the dough is ready, tidy it up and start fermentation.<br />
Cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying, and let it <strong>ferment at room temperature for 60 minutes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-shaping-and-resting">🍞 Shaping and Resting</h2>

<p>After fermentation, divide the dough into <strong>70g portions</strong>.<br />
This recipe makes 6 salt breads.<br />
If there’s leftover dough, just add a bit to each of the 6 portions.</p>

<p>Now let’s round the dough.<br />
Fold it inward, then roll it into a ball on a mat or with your palm.<br />
Next, shape it into a <strong>tadpole shape</strong> — tapering toward the tail is key!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-shaping01.JPG" alt="Rounding and shaping" /></p>

<p>Let the shaped dough <strong>rest at room temperature for 20 minutes</strong>.<br />
After resting, stretch the dough.<br />
Push the top part and pull the bottom part downward as you roll.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-butter-filling-and-shaping-tips">🧈 Butter Filling and Shaping Tips</h2>

<p>Now place the butter filling on the top part and gently roll it up.<br />
Repeat the same for the rest of the dough.</p>

<p>Some salt bread recipes suggest sealing the sides after adding butter,<br />
while others leave them open.</p>

<p>Korean master baker <strong>Bread Junseo</strong> says:<br />
“For salt bread, leaving the sides open allows the butter to naturally flow out and absorb into the bottom,<br />
making it crispy.”<br />
So I also leave the sides open.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-final-proof-and-baking">🔥 Final Proof and Baking</h2>

<p>Let the shaped dough <strong>proof for about 60 minutes</strong>.<br />
Usually, you sprinkle a bit of salt on top after proofing,<br />
but I skipped that this time.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to <strong>220°C</strong>,<br />
then bake at <strong>200°C for 20 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>Once baked, your salt bread is ready!<br />
It’s delicious as is, but if you <strong>brush a little leftover butter on top</strong>,<br />
it adds a glossy finish and makes it look even more appetizing.</p>

<p>After cooling a bit, cracks may appear on the surface —<br />
but I find that adds to its charm.</p>

<h2 id="-wrapping-up">💛 Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Though I’m self-taught and still learning,<br />
the biggest reward is seeing my <strong>family enjoy the bread</strong>.<br />
Since it’s my husband’s favorite, I keep coming back to it.</p>

<p>Salt bread uses simple ingredients,<br />
and with a little care, you can make it delicious at home.</p>

<p>I hope you give it a try :)<br />
The savory aroma from the oven and a warm table<br />
can make your day just a little happier.</p>
